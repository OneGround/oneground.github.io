| ZRC, BRC, DRC Listener | Rabbitmq has been replaced by Hangfire as a mechanism for dipatching notifications from BRC and ZRC to DRC. DRC Listener now has an endpoint for receiving notifications.                                                                                                                                                      | It is now easier to combine OneGround registrations with other registrations. For example, a OneGround BRC can be combined with an external DRC and vice versa. |                                 | Systeembeheerders kunnen nu notificaties van BRC en ZRC bekijken en beheren in het Hangfire-dashboard. |
| CSV                    | Swagger endpoints for CSV have been completed, especially those for ZSDMS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                 |                                 |                                                                                                        |

| ZRC, DRC               | When a date/time was returned, for example a registration date of the case, it was returned without timezone indication. ISO-8601 says: "If the time is in UTC, add a Z directly after the time without a space". Now the Z has been added.                                                                                    | This might be a breaking change                                                                                                                                 |                                 |                                                                                                        |

| All ZGW                | Health checks on ZGW API's did not follow the Roxit standard and created errors for monitoring tools. Now, an authenticated health endpoint has been added.                                                                                                                                                                    | Monitoring tools now can use the authenticated endpoint                                                                                                         |                                 |                                                                                                        |
| ZCA                    | The edit-possibilities of subscriptions have been removed. The reason is that filter options were not shown, and the result of editing was therefore unpredictable. Also automatically insertion of subscriptions by CSV makes manual editing superfluous. A tooltip was added showing the filter values of each subscription. |                                                                                                                                                                 |                                 |                                                                                                        |
