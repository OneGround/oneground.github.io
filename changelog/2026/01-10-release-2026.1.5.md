| NRC Listener | The retry mechanism for sending notifications has been improved with separate retry queues in Hangfire. Unresponding endpoints now are temporarily marked as unhealthy to prevent unnecessary loads of retry notifications.                                                                                 |                                   |                                 |                                             |
| DRC          | There were errors when deleting documents, possibly because of simultaneous API delete calls on enkelvoudiginformatieobjects and objectinformatieobjects. The delete queries within the delete operation for enkelvoudiginformatieobjects now have been separated in order to prevent concurrency problems. |                                   |                                 |                                             |
