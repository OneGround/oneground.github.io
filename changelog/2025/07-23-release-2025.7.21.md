| ZRC       | Improved support of zaken \_zoek endpoint. Not all fields requiered by the standard were supported. Now all fields including uuid\_\_in supported.        |                                 |
| ZTC       | A patch on a field of a case type resulted in an error on yet another field under certain conditions. This has been solved.                               |                                 |
| ZTC       | The field informatieobjectcategorie was added in ZTC 1.2 and is required (a breaking change). In OneGround it still was not required. Now it is required. |                                 |
