| DRC          | Two-letter and capital language codes were accepted in attribute 'taal' whereas the standard allows only three lowercase letters. Now the taal is checked on valid ISO-values. In case of often occuring deviating values like NLD or nl, it is replaced by nld.        |                                   |                                 |                                             |
| NRC LISTENER | After the last retry on sending a notitifcation to an non-responding endpoint an Error was logged. Because of this the logs were full of errors of external systems while the NRC was functioning correctly. For this reason the error level now is reduced to Warning. |                                   |                                 |
